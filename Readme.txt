📋 Implementation Guidelines for Developers:

🎨 CSS Standards:
    /* Core theme variables for consistent styling */
    :root {
        --color-body-primary: #4ade80;
        --color-mind-primary: #3b82f6;
        --color-soul-primary: #8b5cf6;

        --shadow-light: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        --border-radius: 1rem;
    }

🔧 JavaScript Patterns:
    // State management pattern used across components
    const AppState = {
        currentCategory: null,
        searchTerm: '',
        userPreferences: {},
        
        updateCategory(category) {
            this.currentCategory = category;
            this.saveToStorage();
            this.notifyComponents();
        }
    };

    // Event system for component communication
    const EventBus = {
        events: {},
        
        emit(event, data) {
            if (this.events[event]) {
                this.events[event].forEach(callback => callback(data));
            }
        },
        
        on(event, callback) {
            if (!this.events[event]) this.events[event] = [];
            this.events[event].push(callback);
        }
    };

📱 Responsive Implementation:
    /* Mobile-first responsive breakpoints */

        .card { margin-bottom: 1rem; }
    }
    
    @media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
        .grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }
    }
    
    @media (min-width: 1025px) {
        .grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); }
        .hover-effects { transition: var(--transition-smooth); }
    }

            if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                const img = entry.target;
                img.src = img.dataset.src;
                img.classList.remove('lazy');
                imageObserver.unobserve(img);
            }
        });
    });

    // Debounced search for performance
    const debounce = (func, wait) => {
        let timeout;
        return function executedFunction(...args) {
            const later = () => {
                clearTimeout(timeout);
                func(...args);
            };
